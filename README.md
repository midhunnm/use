### Project Description

Tiltify is a web page that moves and tilts in sync with your device‚Äôs physical movement.
If you shake it, it shakes. If you tilt it, it leans. It has no practical use, but it‚Äôs strangely satisfying.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)

Websites just sit there‚Ä¶ boring and still. Your phone has fancy sensors ‚Äî why waste them on navigation and gaming when you can make a website seasick?

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)

We hijack your device‚Äôs motion sensors (accelerometer & gyroscope) and use them to apply 3D CSS transforms to the entire page.
Now your browsing experience feels like balancing a plate of soup while walking.

If you want, I can also make a **funny ‚Äúmotion to chaos‚Äù diagram** showing phone movement feeding into Tiltify‚Äôs wobble engine.
Want me to design that next?
